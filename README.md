This program implements "Efficient simulation methods for the Quasi- Gaussian term-structure model with volatility smiles: practical applications of the KLNV-
scheme" by Yuji Shinozaki, 2021. 

The scope of project is limited to Euler-Maruyama scheme and Ninomiya-Victoir scheme for quasi-Gaussian term structure model with Cox-Ingress-Ross (CIR) type volatility.
